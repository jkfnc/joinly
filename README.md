<h1 align="center">Make your meetings accessible to AI Agents 🤖</h1>

**joinly.ai** is a connector middleware designed to enable AI agents to join and actively participate in video calls. Through its MCP server, joinly.ai provides essential [meeting tools](#tools) and [resources](#resources) that can equip any AI agent with the skills to perform tasks and interact with you in real time during your meetings.

# :zap: Quickstart
Run joinly via Docker with a basic conversational agent client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites**: [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joinly-ai/joinly
cd joinly
```

Create a new `.env` file in the project root with your API keys. See [.env.example](.env.example) for complete configuration options including Anthropic (Claude) and Ollama setups. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and adjust the model name as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember not to copy the [.env.example](.env.example) exactly. Instead, delete the placeholder values of the providers you don't use.

```Dotenv
# .env
# for OpenAI LLM
# change key and model to your desired one
JOINLY_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
JOINLY_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
> [!TIP]
> You can find the OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Pull the Docker image (~2.3GB since it packages browser and models):
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest
```

Launch your meeting in [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) or Teams and let joinly join the meeting using the meeting link as `<MeetingURL>`:
```bash  
docker run --env-file .env ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest -v --client <MeetingURL>
```
> :red_circle: Having trouble getting started? Let's figure it out together on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/AN5NEBkS4d)! 

# :technologist: Run an external client
In Quickstart, we ran the Docker Container directly as a client using `--client`. But we can also run it as a server and connect to it from outside the container, which allows us to control the entire logic of our agent. Here, we run an external client implementation and connect it to the joinly MCP server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites**: do the [Quickstart](#zap-quickstart) (except the last command), [install uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), and open two terminals

Start the joinly server in the first terminal (note, we are not using `--client` here and forward port `8000`):
```bash  
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest -v
```

While the server is running, start the example client implementation in the second terminal window to connect to it and join a meeting:
```bash  
uv run examples/client_example.py --mcp-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/ <MeetingUrl>
```

## Add MCP servers to the client
Add the tools of any MCP server to the example client by providing a JSON configuration. In [config_tavily.json](examples/config_tavily.json), we add the Tavily MCP server for web search functionality (requires `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "tavily": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp@0.2.2"]
        }
    }
}
```

You can also add multiple entries under `"mcpServers"` which will all be available as tools in the meeting (see [fastmcp client docs](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client) for config syntax). Then, run the client using the config file (`--config <file>`):

```bash  
uv run examples/client_example.py --mcp-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/ --config examples/config_tavily.json <MeetingUrl>
```

# :wrench: Configurations

```bash
# Start server (default), connect via own client
uv run joinly

# Start directly as client
uv run joinly --client <MeetingUrl>

# Change name (default: joinly)
uv run joinly --name "AI Assistant"

# Change TTS provider
uv run joinly --tts kokoro # default: local Kokoro
uv run joinly --tts deepgram # include DEEPGRAM_API_KEY in your .env

# Change Transcription (STT) provider
uv run joinly --stt whisper # default: local Whisper (faster-whisper)
uv run joinly --stt deepgram # include DEEPGRAM_API_KEY in your .env

# Change host & port of the joinly MCP server
uv run joinly --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Start browser with a VNC server for debugging;
# forward the port and connect to it using a VNC client
uv run joinly --vnc-server --vnc-server-port 5900

# Use browser agent as fallback/to join any meeting website (Experimental)
# Note: this requires npx (not installed in the docker but in devcontainer),
# LLM is selected using the same ENV variables as described earlier
uv run joinly --browser-agent playwright-mcp

# Logging
uv run joinly -v  # or -vv, -vvv

# Help
uv run joinly --help
```

## GPU Support

We provide a Docker image with CUDA GPU support for running the transcription and TTS models on a GPU. To use it, you need to have the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) installed and `CUDA >= 12.6`. Then pull the CUDA-enabled image:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly-cuda:latest
```

Run as client or server with the same commands as above, but use the `joinly-cuda` image and set `--gpus all`:
```bash
# Run as server
docker run --gpus all --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly-cuda:latest -v
# Run as client
docker run --gpus all --env-file .env ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly-cuda:latest -v --client <MeetingURL>
```

By default, the `joinly` image uses the Whisper model `base.en` for transcription, since it still runs reasonably fast on CPU. For `joinly-cuda`, it automatically defaults to `distil-large-v3` for significantly better transcription quality. You can change the model by setting `--stt-arg model_name=<model_name>` (e.g., `--stt-arg model_name=large-v3`). However, only the respective default models are packaged in the docker image, so it will start to download the model weights on container start.

# :test_tube: Create your own client

You can also write your own client from scratch and connect it to our joinly MCP server. See [client_example.py](examples/client_example.py) for a starting point.

The joinly MCP server provides following tools and resources:

### Tools

- **`join_meeting`** - Join meeting with URL, participant name, and optional passcode
- **`leave_meeting`** - Leave the current meeting
- **`speak_text`** - Speak text using TTS (requires `text` parameter)
- **`send_chat_message`** - Send chat message (requires `message` parameter)
- **`mute_yourself`** - Mute microphone
- **`unmute_yourself`** - Unmute microphone
- **`get_chat_history`** - Get current meeting chat history in JSON format
- **`get_participants`** - Get current meeting participants in JSON format
- **`get_transcript`** - Get current meeting transcript in JSON format, optionally filtered by minutes
- *more soon...*

### Resources

- `transcript://live` - Live meeting transcript in JSON format, including timestamps and speaker information. Subscribable for real-time updates when new utterances are added.

# :building_construction: Developing joinly.ai

For development we recommend using the development container, which installs all necessary dependencies. To get started, install the DevContainer Extension for Visual Studio Code, open the repository and choose **Reopen in Container**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joinly-ai/assets/main/images/others/reopen_in_container.png" width="500" alt="Reopen in Devcontainer">

The installation can take some time, since it downloads all packages as well as models for Whisper/Kokoro and the Chromium browser. At the end, it automatically invokes the [download_assets.py](scripts/download_assets.py) script. If you see errors like `Missing kokoro-v1.0.onnx`, run this script manually using:
```bash
uv run scripts/download_assets.py
```

We'd love to see what you are using it for or building with it. Showcase your work on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/AN5NEBkS4d)
